# SciFace

This was an assignment to simulate genetic drift in a population with different alleles for an arbitrary trait. 
The number of generations must be <=100 and stops when: the number of generations == 100 OR until the frequency of the recessive allele pair 'aa' reaches 0%.
A random seed was not set as randomness was necessary for each simulation epoch.
